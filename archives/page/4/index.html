</blockquote>
<p>This teaches the important lesson that we need to remember that christ always wants us. He never ever is too ashamed of us. He doesn’t only want to have the top 10% be saved he would save everyone if he could, and we all can if we turn and follow him.</p>

<p>I think this is such a beautifull verse! It gives me hope to see Christ tell us that we can be saved. A simple and perhaps obvious truth, but a beautifull one none the less.</p>

<p>This one is a really interesting one because it seems the song ruined it for me for a while because the song doesn’t include any of verses before it. With the verse before it you realize that he’s talking about people who say they follow Christ but don’t live it. Always a good reminder to me to make sure I’m a Mormon in word as well as deed.</p>

<p>I really can’t not write about this one. It’s just so true. In this world where we want our <a href="http://welcome.pushforpizza.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">pizza at the push of a button</a> we often time say, “Just give me the answer”. When often times our ability to reason an choose, to learn endlessly is one of our most prized possessions! I try to always keep this in mind when I end up teaching somone somthing. If they can’t do it themselves, they haven’t really learned it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is interesting. It shows how the savior used parables to only let out that information that those who are dilligent will figure out. The people that he wants to reveal information to. Another reminder to make sure that I look more closely at what he says and what the current prophet says.</p>

<p>I really like this scripture because I is like a recipe on how we can be blessed! Plus it’s just a really good rundown of values.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I’ve thought a lot about this one lately. I think it’s all too easy to say, oh I’ll love my enimies and not really understand what that all entails. Often times I think we decive ourselves  and think, “I don’t really have any enemies. I don’t think we can be more wrong. There’s a lot of people we don’t like and often times we don’t even really realize it. They can be co-workers, people we go to school with or even our Family. It’s all to easy to love our friends. But to pray for someone while they are in the act of trying to hurt you? Now that is a whole different level of difficulty. We’re not going to be perfect at it. I know I’m not, but I think it’s a very important rule to live by.</p>

<p>One that we all need to hear. It reminds me of a TED talk where she said, Realizing your wrong may feel awful but <em>being</em> wrong feels like being <strong>right</strong>. We notice the faults all to easily when they are before us. Somtimes we are our worst critic. </p>

<p>This has been one of my favorite scriptures for a very long time. I love it because it says, “Hey all that stuff that you worry about, having a Job, enought to eat, understanding school, If you put me first I’ll give you all those things and more”. I think that’s somthing I really need to hear when I get all stressed over things.”</p>

<p>28 And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:</p>
<p>29 May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.</p>
<p>30 And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection.</p>
<p>31 And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing, and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.</p>
<p>32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God. And they did cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.</p>
<p>33 And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.<br>~ 3 Nephi 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this one rather interesting because it does seem a bit odd that they are rejoicing so much over a man’s death but at the same time I can understand why. Someone who caused so much pain and horror surely was good to see a stop put to him. </p>
