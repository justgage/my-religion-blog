</blockquote>
<p>This is quite the interesting look into the law of consecration! It is crazy to think of how easily it solves world hunger and many other ills of life. Naturally it also takes complete selflessness as well. It was interesting once I had a companion who said that missions pretty much where the law of consecration! We got the money we needed and a little more in exchange for the leibor we did! I think this will be amazing when it does happen because it means all good jobs will be adequately paid, especially teachers. </p>

<p>3 Nephi 30</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is an important one because it pertains directly to our day. It’s a good stark reminder of some of the things we need to avoid at all costs. In our media consumption as well as our actions.</p>

<p>3 Nephi 29</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes I just pasted the entire chapter but I really couldn’t pick which part to cut out! Anyway I like this scripture because it helps me to remember that in the end all is going to be fair. The Lord has his sword of justice and we don’t need to fill that role. Which I believe means judging others and seeking to “get even”. It also means to me that if I do what I need to do then I can be saved. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think what struck me about this scripture was that the Lord told us that <strong>we</strong> discern between good and evil. Meaning we can’t expect God to say, “That’s a bad movie” every time we are at the ticket booth, we have to decide for ourselves what is good and what is evil. Not just passive thought but active thought as well. Sometimes I think that this is the reason that we don’t get answers to prayers because God’s like, “Common, you know this one!”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This scripture makes me wonder if God’s going to hold us accountable for keeping a Journal. I’m not that great at keeping a journal but I think it’s important because it gives us a way to record what we are thankful for and helps us record what means the most to us in our lives.</p>

<p>This is a really good one! It brings up a really good example of how we should pray. I know for myself I have a major problem with repeating the same thing over and over again. I think when we let the Holy Ghost guide us in our prayer we do a lot better. </p>

<p>I think this a great scripture because it shows how the people had such a great experiance their immidiate desire was to share their experiance with others. I think this is a great example of how excited we should be to share the gospel.</p>
