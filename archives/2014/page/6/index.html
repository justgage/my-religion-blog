        <p>I chose prayer because I’ve been doing very badly with doing personal prayers in the moring <em>and</em> I feel like my prayers could be made much more meaningful. I really want to have a more meaningful relationship with God.</p>
<p>Below are a list of reasons for prayer or doctorine about it in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that we must ask for in order to obtain.”</p>
<p>“12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.</p>
<p>13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.”<br>~ Jerimiah 29:12-13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really like this verse because it helps me to understand <em>why</em> we pray.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;”<br>~ Matthew 5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should even pray for those that hate us! Or abuse us! It must be imperitive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> 10 Remember that without faith you can do nothing; therefore ask in faith. Trifle not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not.<br>~ D&amp;C 8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tells me that we really need to be careful what we pray for. If we end up praying for things that are wrong, that could be really bad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>37 Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.<br>~ Alma 37</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons we pray is because we need God’s daily direction, not just bailing us out when we’re in a jam.  If we do this we shall be lifted up at the last day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most meaningful things we can do as parents is teach our children the power of prayer, not just the routine of prayer.<br>PARENTS: THE PRIME GOSPEL TEACHERS OF THEIR CHILDREN by TAD R. CALLISTER</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I loved this talk from the last generel confrence and I found this phrase particularly pertinent. IT helpedme to realize that it wasn’t enough to just say your dialy prayers but you needed to make sure that you where actually comunicating with God verses just talking at him.</p>

        <p>I really like Alma 42. Lately I’ve been very interested about understanding the atonement better, and these verses seem to have a lot of good stuff about it. Like these verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>24 For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also amercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</p>
<p>25 What, do ye suppose that amercy can rob bjustice? I say unto you, Nay;not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.</p>
<p>26 And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal apurposes, which were prepared bfrom the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s very interesting how it says. “Justice exerciseth all his demands” this makes me think that justice is God’s way of getting done what he needs to get done. These are the hard a fast laws that he has made for his kingdom and anyone who wants to live in his kingdom must obey them. They are what makes heaven, heaven. If he let all the people of the earth into heaven it would instantly become what the earth is now. Having rules for the conduct of those that live there makes the society of heaven work. However we all know that on this earth we are not part of heaven yet. We are very much like a graduate looking for a job. We are trying to do everything we can to prove that we are heaven material and that with a little on the job training we are going to be valuable. That’s where mercy comes in. Mercy is not law. It is understanding. Going back to the interview analogy, it’s the interviewer looking at the candidate, and seeing potential. No more than potential, commitment. Mercy is what says, “I know this person may not be perfect now, but there’s no doubt that they will eventually become perfect because their commitment to it is unwavering.” Justice isn’t that complex. It doesn’t understand this reasoning. If justice was purely relied on, anyone who had 4.0 would be hired and everyone would just go home. End of story.</p>
<p>Hopefully that analogy helps you guys out. It seemed to help me.</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>4 And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil. Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame—mortality raised to immortality, corruption to incorruption—raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other—</p>
<p>5 The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.</p>
<p>6 And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.<br>~ Alma 41</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a powerful verse! It really speaks to me that we are as happy as we decide to be! Which is an empowering (and perhaps frustrating if we’re not happy) thing to know.  While sometimes we may feel like it’s hard to know if we are good, if we’re going to make it, I do find this verse quite enlightening. It seems to reaffirm my suspicions that sin often times has a lot more to do with our <em>intentions</em> then it has to do with our actual actions. But then again our intentions heavily influence our actions so we can’t suppose that we are good on the inside and be doing horrible things on the outside. It just doesn’t work that way.</p>

        <p>Lately I’ve been getting very behind in my studies. It’s hard to say where all the time in the day goes. But I do know that I ‘futt’. Meaning that I fiddle and waste time just looking at a blog post out (blank) and play a game for <code>factorial(timeIMentToSpend)</code>. How do I solve this? I feel I need to give myself more pourpose, I need to realize what I do now <em>will</em> effect my grade latter. Not to mention <em>how much I learn</em>. I think I really need to become passionate about doing what I do. Really become a computer science.</p>

<p>I really like this scripture because it focuses on how God cares very deeply for his children. He carefully plans ways that we can return to him.</p>

        <p>I’ve been on this assignment for like 3 days now. Started in probably at least 3 different languages. Spent hours thinking about how to solve it without brute forcing it too bad. I think it really hit me today that one of my major weaknesses as a programmer is my perfectionism gets in the way and then things that should of taken me a few hours end up taking me a few days. Which is pretty much what literally happened the last few days. Hopefully they will appreciate my solution. It’s really not all that impressive sadly because I spent forever trying to find out a way to make it faster and all “functional”</p>

<p>I think it’s interesting how they where given such a great gift, of somthing so magical to their time, yet all too soon it became commonplace and they forgot to call apon it. It’s also intresting to think of it in contrast with the gift of the Holy Ghost because do we somtimes forget we have it? Do we forget to listen to the spirit and not simply our logic and emotions? I know I do. </p>

<p>This reminded me that I need to acknolage my weekness and unworthiness to the Lord constantly. In school I often think of the terms, “I’m smart” and “I’m dumb” but in reality I’m somewhere in the middle and I’m also in desprate need of my father in heaven’s help.</p>
