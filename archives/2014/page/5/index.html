<p>And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen—<br>~ 3 Nephi 1:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a really interesting scripture because it shows how quickly we forget. It really reaffirms the fact for me that we can’t be <em>convinced</em> the gospel is true, we have to let it into our hearts and gain a testimony willingly and sinserely. Signs just don’t work because it really just comes down to, am I willing to be <em>convinced</em>, do I <strong>want</strong> to know the truth?</p>
<p>Another good point from this passage is that we need to be constantly converting ourselves. If we wait too long eventually we will become, “less astonished.”</p>

<p>6 But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains,saying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil;and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.<br>~ Helaman 16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scripture shows a pattern that I’ve started to notice while reading the book of mormon. Evil people always seems to accuse good people of being evil! Even christ himself was often accused of such! My theory is that it’s really the only way that evil people can live with themselves. They have to convince themselves that they are good.</p>

<p>4 But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated because their deeds<br>have been evil continually, and this because of the iniquity of the tradition<br>of their fathers. But behold, salvation hath come unto them through the<br>preaching of the Nephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their<br>days.</p>
<p>5 And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them are in the<br>path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do<br>observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments according<br>to the law of Moses.</p>
<p>6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they<br>are striving with unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of<br>their brethren to the knowledge of the truth; therefore there are many who do<br>add to their numbers daily.<br>~ Heleman 5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s so cool that the Lamanites after converting seem to be even more on fire then the Nephites. I think this is generelly true when it comes to converts in the church. They do a lot more missionary work. However I think it should be the other way arround. People who have grew up in the church should be continually growing more and more spiritual and we should be doing missinary work more than anyone else.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is an interesting scripture that shows that perhaps there was even<br>some racisim between the Nephites and the Lamanites. This never occored to me<br>before! I know racisim isn’t as bad as it was once but that doesn’t mean we<br>don’t have to worry about being judgemental.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think we’ve all heard how, “Wickedness never was happiness” yet I think this really solidified it in my mind. It is just simply <em>impossible</em> to be happy and to be wicked. It’s the great lie that Satan has been eternially trying to sell.  Why? Most likely because it’s the only way that what he does is legitimate at all. He has to lie to himself to live with himself each day. Every evil person does.</p>
<p>So will you live the path of denial, or self deceit? Or are you going to truly be happy? It’s your choice!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is such a perfect example of repentance. It shows that the people humbled themselves and they cast out all evil till they had no more, they had burried up all that had been there. They had truly forsaken it. I think this is a very important thing to remember when we repent, to do it as fully as they did.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think these verses are really applicable to us in our lives. Whenever we find ourselves in spiritual darkness we need to ask God sincerely, “What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?” and then do exactly what he asks us to do, which will invariably be some sort of form of repentance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land—<br>~ Alma 46</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a great analogy of how we should make our values so much a part of us that it even shows when people look at us. I really believe that we can all be more open with our religion.</p>
<h1 id="Tuesday">Tuesday</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>22 Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression.<br>~ Alma 36</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great one on commitment. They take their covenants they make with the lord dead serious. I think many times I take ordinances much too lightly. Especially the Sacrament. It’s all too easy to just take the bread and water and not think about it for the rest of the week. </p>
<h1 id="Wednesday">Wednesday</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>11 And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery;</p>
<p>12 Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</p>
<p>13 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.<br>~ Alma 48</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really admire Moroni. I like the part when it says, “he was a man of a perfect understanding”. I think this means that he was very wise. Often times I find myself as I strive for knowledge I forget to cultivate wisdom in myself.</p>
<h1 id="Thursday">Thursday</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>10 But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come to battle against the Nephites.<br>~ Alma 51</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a great <em>bad</em> example. I think it’s interesting how an entire war can be started just because one man made a decision that was rash and had too much pride to change it even if he did realize it’s bad. It reminds me that looking stupid is far greater than doing something stupid.</p>
<h1 id="Friday">Friday</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>56 But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.<br>~ Alma 56</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this joyful account of the stripling warriors triumph. I am always amazed by how vigilant these young men where and what faith they had.</p>

<p>I find this interesting. I don”t suspect that any of us are engaged in secret combinations of this degree, but I think we do have to watch how much we get into “fitting in”. We often times want to be “stylish” or “cool” and perhaps do things we shouldn’t, or if nothing else we assosiate ourselves with things we shouldn’t.</p>
