<p>5 Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers, and repent of all your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby he hath gained the victory over the grave; and also in him is the sting of death swallowed up.</p>
<p>6 And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his judgment-seat.</p>
<p>7 And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.</p>
<p>8 Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you, not only in this record but also in the record which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come from the Gentiles unto you.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is all the more powerful if we think about what just happened. His plea for repentance is too late for his people but it’s not too late for us. What a very powerful testimony!</p>

<p>I think it’s very sad to see, as Mormon Pointed out, how good people can fall. It’s a warning to us all that none of us are immune. </p>

<p>I think this a great glipse into the character of Mormon. It shows that even as a child he was very obedient and listened to the lord well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Being a prophet isn’t easy! The lord doesn’t only tell you to preach when they will repent but also when they won’t. I had to remember this when I was on my mission (and now) because often times you may think that people are lost causes because they don’t react to feeling the Holy Ghost or they get worse when you want them to get better. We just have to remember that the Lord does everything in his power (short of forcing us) to help us come back. But the reality is, we still have our choice! We can choose to go against God. We are the creators of our own destiny. Don’t dispair when your friends don’t accept the gospel. You gave them a choice and that’s a good thing. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is quite the interesting look into the law of consecration! It is crazy to think of how easily it solves world hunger and many other ills of life. Naturally it also takes complete selflessness as well. It was interesting once I had a companion who said that missions pretty much where the law of consecration! We got the money we needed and a little more in exchange for the leibor we did! I think this will be amazing when it does happen because it means all good jobs will be adequately paid, especially teachers. </p>

<p>I think this is an important one because it pertains directly to our day. It’s a good stark reminder of some of the things we need to avoid at all costs. In our media consumption as well as our actions.</p>

<p>Yes I just pasted the entire chapter but I really couldn’t pick which part to cut out! Anyway I like this scripture because it helps me to remember that in the end all is going to be fair. The Lord has his sword of justice and we don’t need to fill that role. Which I believe means judging others and seeking to “get even”. It also means to me that if I do what I need to do then I can be saved. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think what struck me about this scripture was that the Lord told us that <strong>we</strong> discern between good and evil. Meaning we can’t expect God to say, “That’s a bad movie” every time we are at the ticket booth, we have to decide for ourselves what is good and what is evil. Not just passive thought but active thought as well. Sometimes I think that this is the reason that we don’t get answers to prayers because God’s like, “Common, you know this one!”.</p>

<p>This scripture makes me wonder if God’s going to hold us accountable for keeping a Journal. I’m not that great at keeping a journal but I think it’s important because it gives us a way to record what we are thankful for and helps us record what means the most to us in our lives.</p>
