<p>A great one on missionary work. It makes me think that missionary work is akin to helping people to come home.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a really good one! It brings up a really good example of how we should pray. I know for myself I have a major problem with repeating the same thing over and over again. I think when we let the Holy Ghost guide us in our prayer we do a lot better. </p>

<p>This is a simple one, but a good one. It reminds me to pray in my heart and keep God in my thoughts daily as I work my way through dificult times.</p>

<p> 2 And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before it was yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered unto them, and that he would also show himself on the morrow unto the multitude.</p>
<p> 3 Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that there were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor exceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude.<br>~ 3 Nephi 19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this a great scripture because it shows how the people had such a great experiance their immidiate desire was to share their experiance with others. I think this is a great example of how excited we should be to share the gospel.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This teaches the important lesson that we need to remember that christ always wants us. He never ever is too ashamed of us. He doesn’t only want to have the top 10% be saved he would save everyone if he could, and we all can if we turn and follow him.</p>

<p>I think this is such a beautifull verse! It gives me hope to see Christ tell us that we can be saved. A simple and perhaps obvious truth, but a beautifull one none the less.</p>

<p>This one is a really interesting one because it seems the song ruined it for me for a while because the song doesn’t include any of verses before it. With the verse before it you realize that he’s talking about people who say they follow Christ but don’t live it. Always a good reminder to me to make sure I’m a Mormon in word as well as deed.</p>

<p>I really can’t not write about this one. It’s just so true. In this world where we want our <a href="http://welcome.pushforpizza.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">pizza at the push of a button</a> we often time say, “Just give me the answer”. When often times our ability to reason an choose, to learn endlessly is one of our most prized possessions! I try to always keep this in mind when I end up teaching somone somthing. If they can’t do it themselves, they haven’t really learned it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is interesting. It shows how the savior used parables to only let out that information that those who are dilligent will figure out. The people that he wants to reveal information to. Another reminder to make sure that I look more closely at what he says and what the current prophet says.</p>

<p>I really like this scripture because I is like a recipe on how we can be blessed! Plus it’s just a really good rundown of values.</p>
