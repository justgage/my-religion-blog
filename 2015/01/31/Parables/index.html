Parables as<br>according to Wikipedia (not the most authoritative source obviously) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> is a succinct, didactic story, in prose or verse, which illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. It differs from a fable in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters. A parable is a type of analogy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think a better question is why did Christ use them? It seems that the main reason hide what he’s actually trying to say to them! Sounds weird doesn’t it? Why would Christ want someone to not get his message? I think that the reason is because the message isn’t what’s most important part! You see, a message isn’t any good unless we understand it, and even more importantly, <em>care</em>. I mean I may know that someone needs help but if I don’t care what good does that do them? The same is with Gospel principles. If we don’t care about them they can not change our lives for the better. So the saviour uses parables so that only people that are truly seeking will find the meaning in them.</p>
