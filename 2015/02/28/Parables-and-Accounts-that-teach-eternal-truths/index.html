<p>Jesus’ parables are not always easy to understand, I’m going to go through 5 today and hopefully gain a better understanding of them!</p>
<h1 id="The_unjust_steward_(Luke_16:1-12)">The unjust steward (Luke 16:1-12)</h1>
<p>This a bit of a weird one. It basically sounds like there’s this person “the unjust steward”<br>who mannages the money and property of a rich man. Somone tells the rich man that he’s<br>recklessly squandering his master’s property. So the rich man comes down on him then<br>the steward goes to some of his masters debtors and offered them huge discounts. For<br>some reason the master was very pleased with this.</p>
<p>From the commentary I’ve read it seems that the Lord was pointing some things about finances. Like<br>how we need to still make sure we give careful attention to our temporal affairs and we need to<br>be friends with people that are not members of the church beccause we never know when they will<br>help bring about good.</p>
<h1 id="Lazarus_and_the_rich_man_-_Luke_16:19-31">Lazarus and the rich man - Luke 16:19-31</h1>
<p>Another rich man! In this one there’s lazarus who’s a poor begar that lives off crubs that fall from the rich man’s table.<br>The rich man is well, rich and thus has the many benifits of that. They both die. Lazarus goes to heaven and is confortable<br>and no longer crippled. The rich man is not so lucky and is torrmented to the point that even a drop of water from the from<br>Lazarus would be welcome. So we see their roles are reversed. Which goes back to the “last shall be first and the first shall<br>be last” thing.</p>
<p>I think one of the main things that we can learn from this is that don’t think that this life’s conforts are the most important thing!<br>Because they will soon end and the eternity will begin where we have to live with the person we’ve become in this life. No more cheating<br>the system, things will finally be fair.</p>
<h1 id="The_ten_lepers_-_Luke_17:11-19">The ten lepers - Luke 17:11-19</h1>
<p>This is one of my favorites as a child. I think perhaps because of it’s ease in understanding. How it goes is Christ finds 10 leapers<br>and they ask to be healed, christ tells them to go see the preists and on their way they get healed! However only one came back<br>to Jesus and thanked him (the other’s where probably partying with their friends or somthing.) Jesus made an interesting comment about<br>the one,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>19 And he said unto him, Arise, go they way: they faith hath made thee whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s interesting to note that while some may be healed this man was made whole. The verse seems to indicate that <em>wholeness</em> is<br>different than <em>cleanlyness</em>. Both are most cirtantly important but I think he does show that they change has gone more than skin deep<br>with the greatful man then with the others.</p>
<h1 id="The_parable_of_the_unjust_judge_-_Luke_18:1-8">The parable of the unjust judge - Luke 18:1-8</h1>
<p>Basically the story goes, there’s an unjust judge that has this widow who is pleading with him to advenge her. He resists at first then<br>decides that although he is not affraid of God or man but he’s affraid that she will continue to annoy him till he gives in so he does.</p>
<p>The pourpose is explicitly stated at the beginning of the verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 And he spake a parable unto them <em>to this end</em>, that men ought always to pray, and not faint;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So as the widow was a great example of how persistant we should be. Even a bad judge will eventually listen to her how much more quickly<br>will God listen to us. It shows faith to not continue to belive that God will come through which I think Jesus was trying to show.</p>
<h1 id="The_parable_of_the_Pharisee_and_the_publican-_-_Luke_18:9-14">The parable of the Pharisee and the publican. - Luke 18:9-14</h1>
<p>This one is about a Pharisee and a publican that both go to pray. THe Pharisee basically prays, “Thanks that I’m not a horrible sinner<br>like that other guy” meanwhile the publican says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much <em>his</em> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon<br>his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is very poignant. We need to not think that we’ve made it we need to realize that we desprately need God’s help and plead to<br>him for his help.</p>
