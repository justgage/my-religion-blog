<p>3 Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye cannot be saved.</p>
<p>4 Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight no more in the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save it be that God shall command you.</p>
<p>5 Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers, and repent of all your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby he hath gained the victory over the grave; and also in him is the sting of death swallowed up.</p>
<p>6 And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his judgment-seat.</p>
<p>7 And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.</p>
<p>8 Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you, not only in this record but also in the record which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come from the Gentiles unto you.</p>
<p>~ Mormon 7</p>

<p>This is all the more powerful if we think about what just happened. His plea for repentance is too late for his people but itâ€™s not too late for us. What a very powerful testimony!</p>
