<p>1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p>
<p>2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p>3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>
<p>4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye—and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</p>
<p>5 Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother’s eye.<br>~ 3 Nephi 14</p>

<p>One that we all need to hear. It reminds me of a TED talk where she said, Realizing your wrong may feel awful but <em>being</em> wrong feels like being <strong>right</strong>. We notice the faults all to easily when they are before us. Somtimes we are our worst critic. </p>
