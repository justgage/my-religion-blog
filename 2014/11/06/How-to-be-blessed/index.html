<p>3 Yea, blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>4 And again, blessed are all they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>
<p>5 And blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p>6 And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>7 And blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</p>
<p>8 And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>
<p>9 And blessed are all the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.</p>
<p>10 And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my name�s sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>11 And blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake;</p>
<p>12 For ye shall have great joy and be exceedingly glad, for great shall be your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.<br>~ 3 Nephi </p>

<p>I really like this scripture because I is like a recipe on how we can be blessed! Plus it’s just a really good rundown of values.</p>
