<p> 1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven, the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his children and did return to his own home.</p>
<p> 2 And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before it was yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered unto them, and that he would also show himself on the morrow unto the multitude.</p>
<p> 3 Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that there were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor exceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude.<br>~ 3 Nephi 19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this a great scripture because it shows how the people had such a great experiance their immidiate desire was to share their experiance with others. I think this is a great example of how excited we should be to share the gospel.</p>
