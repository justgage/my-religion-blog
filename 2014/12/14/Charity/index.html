<p>45 And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
<p>46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail—</p>
<p>47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</p>
<p>48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.<br>~ Maroni 7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is a classic. Theres is no doubt the importance of charity. </p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what Charity is:</p>
<ul>
<li>suffereth long</li>
<li>is kind</li>
<li>envieth not</li>
<li>is not puffed up</li>
<li>seeketh not her own</li>
<li>is not easily provoked</li>
<li>thinketh no evil</li>
<li>rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth</li>
<li>beareth all things</li>
<li>believeth all things</li>
<li>hopeth all things</li>
<li>endureth all things</li>
<li>if you don’t have it you are nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>With how he describes Charity it almost makes it sound like all of God’s qualities. I think in many ways if we wanted to describe what God wants us to be I think it would be in the list above. This sort of makes sense in the context of what Christ said about “What is the greates commandment”.</p>
