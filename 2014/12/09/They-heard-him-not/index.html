<p>1 The words of Christ, which he spake unto his disciples, the twelve whom he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon them—</p>
<p>2 And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the Father in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye have done this ye shall have power that to him upon whom ye shall lay your hands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give it, for thus do mine apostles.</p>
<p>3 Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his first appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciples heard it; and on as many as they laid their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>~ Moroni 2</p>

<p>I find this quite interesting how in a literal sense, some people where able to hear Christ speak and others couldn’t and although this time it wasn’t because these people where necessarily wicked or anything like that, I think it reminds me of how much Christ spoke in parables so only those who really wanted to know would, and also how the Holy Ghost speaks to us as well. It makes me want to make sure I’m always listening! Don’t want to him to stop speaking simply because I stop listening!</p>
<p>What helps you make sure you don’t miss out?</p>
