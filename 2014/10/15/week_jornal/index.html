<blockquote>
<p>13 And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land—<br>~ Alma 46</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a great analogy of how we should make our values so much a part of us that it even shows when people look at us. I really believe that we can all be more open with our religion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>22 Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression.<br>~ Alma 36</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great one on commitment. They take their covenants they make with the lord dead serious. I think many times I take ordinances much too lightly. Especially the Sacrament. It’s all too easy to just take the bread and water and not think about it for the rest of the week. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery;</p>
<p>12 Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</p>
<p>13 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.<br>~ Alma 48</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really admire Moroni. I like the part when it says, “he was a man of a perfect understanding”. I think this means that he was very wise. Often times I find myself as I strive for knowledge I forget to cultivate wisdom in myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>10 But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come to battle against the Nephites.<br>~ Alma 51</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a great <em>bad</em> example. I think it’s interesting how an entire war can be started just because one man made a decision that was rash and had too much pride to change it even if he did realize it’s bad. It reminds me that looking stupid is far greater than doing something stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>56 But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.<br>~ Alma 56</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this joyful account of the stripling warriors triumph. I am always amazed by how vigilant these young men where and what faith they had.</p>
