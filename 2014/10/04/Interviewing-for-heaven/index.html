Lately I’ve been very interested about understanding the atonement better, and these verses seem to have a lot of good stuff about it. Like these verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>24 For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also amercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</p>
<p>25 What, do ye suppose that amercy can rob bjustice? I say unto you, Nay;not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.</p>
<p>26 And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal apurposes, which were prepared bfrom the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s very interesting how it says. “Justice exerciseth all his demands” this makes me think that justice is God’s way of getting done what he needs to get done. These are the hard a fast laws that he has made for his kingdom and anyone who wants to live in his kingdom must obey them. They are what makes heaven, heaven. If he let all the people of the earth into heaven it would instantly become what the earth is now. Having rules for the conduct of those that live there makes the society of heaven work. However we all know that on this earth we are not part of heaven yet. We are very much like a graduate looking for a job. We are trying to do everything we can to prove that we are heaven material and that with a little on the job training we are going to be valuable. That’s where mercy comes in. Mercy is not law. It is understanding. Going back to the interview analogy, it’s the interviewer looking at the candidate, and seeing potential. No more than potential, commitment. Mercy is what says, “I know this person may not be perfect now, but there’s no doubt that they will eventually become perfect because their commitment to it is unwavering.” Justice isn’t that complex. It doesn’t understand this reasoning. If justice was purely relied on, anyone who had 4.0 would be hired and everyone would just go home. End of story.</p>
<p>Hopefully that analogy helps you guys out. It seemed to help me.</p>
