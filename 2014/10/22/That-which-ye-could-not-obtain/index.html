<p>38 But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the<br>day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your<br>destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives<br>for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing<br>iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which<br>is in our great and Eternal Head.<br>~ Heleman 13</p>

<p>I think we’ve all heard how, “Wickedness never was happiness” yet I think this really solidified it in my mind. It is just simply <em>impossible</em> to be happy and to be wicked. It’s the great lie that Satan has been eternially trying to sell.  Why? Most likely because it’s the only way that what he does is legitimate at all. He has to lie to himself to live with himself each day. Every evil person does.</p>
<p>So will you live the path of denial, or self deceit? Or are you going to truly be happy? It’s your choice!</p>
