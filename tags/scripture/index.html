</blockquote>
<p>It’s almost Christmas and we all want presents right? Well ti seems that God is the most liberal giver of all! He really will give us what we want, <em>if</em> it’s good for us and <em>if</em> we show we really desire it. The scripture above talks about spiritual gifts in particular but I think that his offer really is open to just about everything in our life. </p>

<p>I think this is a thing that we all need to remember, Satan is often the source of bad ideas and bad thoughts. I’m inclined to belive that not every thought in our head is our own (A little bit of a scary thought)! So when you get angry, say to yourself, “That’s what Satan wants me to do. And I’m not going to do it!”</p>

<p>I think this is intersting how strong the wording is concerning the disputations that he talks about. The word <strong>grieveth</strong> seems so strong it makes me think that contentions are very bad in the Lords sight. Yet there is so much fighting in this world! So many arguments. Makes me think I need to work harder to rid myself of them.</p>

<p>45 And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
<p>46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail—</p>
<p>47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</p>
<p>48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.<br>~ Maroni 7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is a classic. Theres is no doubt the importance of charity. </p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what Charity is:</p>
<ul>
<li>suffereth long</li>
<li>is kind</li>
<li>envieth not</li>
<li>is not puffed up</li>
<li>seeketh not her own</li>
<li>is not easily provoked</li>
<li>thinketh no evil</li>
<li>rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth</li>
<li>beareth all things</li>
<li>believeth all things</li>
<li>hopeth all things</li>
<li>endureth all things</li>
<li>if you don’t have it you are nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>With how he describes Charity it almost makes it sound like all of God’s qualities. I think in many ways if we wanted to describe what God wants us to be I think it would be in the list above. This sort of makes sense in the context of what Christ said about “What is the greates commandment”.</p>

        <p>Scripture Activity 1: Moroni 1-7. “I Write a Few More Things”</p>
<p>Moroni stated that he was writing “a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren” (Moroni 1:4). Read through the chapter headings for Moroni 1-7. As you do so, make a list of at least seven truths or teachings that you feel are “of worth” unto the world.</p>
<p>Some doctorine that I think is important:</p>
<ol>
<li>God is real</li>
<li>God is our literal father</li>
<li>Christ’s atonement can heal us if we follow the commandments</li>
<li><p>The Book of Mormon is another testiment of Christ and is true.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Preisthood power is required to preform saving ordinaces (to reach exaltation).</p>
</li>
<li>Christ’s church has been brought back!</li>
<li>Families can be together forever!</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this is a vere that also goes along very well with this topic:</p>
<p>Moroni 7:25 </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming of Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because it tells us to lay hold upon the good things which I belive are in part the 7 items above.</p>
<p>Point number 4 can be illistarted perfectly with Moroni chapter 10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.</p>
<p>4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</p>
<p>6 And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is.</p>
<p>7 And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a scripture I think we need more thean ever in this world. Why? Because today in our society where we have so much that we can fill our time with God commands, “lay hold upon ever good thing” which I belive requires us to let a lot of <em>ok</em> things go in order to make that happen. Things like movies, video games, surfing the itnernet, and TV are prime examples although there’s a thosand other ones.</p>

<p>1 And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and teachers were baptized; and they were not baptized save they brought forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it.</p>
<p>2 Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins.</p>
<p>3 And none were received unto baptism save they took upon them the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.</p>
<p>4 And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.<br>~ Moroni 6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is one of the best descriptions of (some of) the requirements of baptism. I think these are very important to remember because they apply not just to <em>getting</em> baptised but also to keeping the benefits of <em>being</em> baptised. None of them are easy to do! Having a broken heart and a contrite spirit all the time is constantly combated by the parts of our hearts that are prideful and contrite is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Broken down with grief and penitence; deeply sorrowful for sin because it is displeasing to God; humbly and thoroughly penitent.<br>~ 1913 Webster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe your better than me but I know I don’t always my sins as horrible <em>before</em> I do them. Many times is far after I say, “Yeah probably shouldn’t have done that” after the fact.</p>
<p>How does seeing these facts effect the way you think about your baptism?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I really like this scripture because it shows us in the simplest way how we can determine what is from him and what isn’t. Satan man mix things that are good into what he says but he will never ultimately invite you to love God and serve him (that is the true God). It would go entirely against his pourposes, and therefore he will always have a very nicely sounding idea that ultimately leads to anything but a good destination. </p>

<p>3 Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his first appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciples heard it; and on as many as they laid their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>~ Moroni 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this quite interesting how in a literal sense, some people where able to hear Christ speak and others couldn’t and although this time it wasn’t because these people where necessarily wicked or anything like that, I think it reminds me of how much Christ spoke in parables so only those who really wanted to know would, and also how the Holy Ghost speaks to us as well. It makes me want to make sure I’m always listening! Don’t want to him to stop speaking simply because I stop listening!</p>
