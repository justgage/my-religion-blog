<p>1 And now behold, I say unto you that when the Lord shall see fit, in his wisdom, that these sayings shall come unto the Gentiles according to his word, then ye may know that the covenant which the Father hath made with the children of Israel, concerning their restoration to the lands of their inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled.<br>2 And ye may know that the words of the Lord, which have been spoken by the holy prophets, shall all be fulfilled; and ye need not say that the Lord delays his coming unto the children of Israel.<br>3 And ye need not imagine in your hearts that the words which have been spoken are vain, for behold, the Lord will remember his covenant which he hath made unto his people of the house of Israel.<br>4 And when ye shall see these sayings coming forth among you, then ye need not any longer spurn at the doings of the Lord, for the sword of his justice is in his right hand; and behold, at that day, if ye shall spurn at his doings he will cause that it shall soon overtake you.<br>5 Wo unto him that spurneth at the doings of the Lord; yea, wo unto him that shall deny the Christ and his works!<br>6 Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord, and that shall say the Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or by gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by the power of the Holy Ghost!<br>7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain, that there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that doeth this shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy, according to the word of Christ!<br>8 Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for behold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to that which he hath sworn.<br>9 Therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn the right hand of the Lord unto the left, that he may not execute judgment unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israel.</p>
<p>3 Nephi 29</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes I just pasted the entire chapter but I really couldn’t pick which part to cut out! Anyway I like this scripture because it helps me to remember that in the end all is going to be fair. The Lord has his sword of justice and we don’t need to fill that role. Which I believe means judging others and seeking to “get even”. It also means to me that if I do what I need to do then I can be saved. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think what struck me about this scripture was that the Lord told us that <strong>we</strong> discern between good and evil. Meaning we can’t expect God to say, “That’s a bad movie” every time we are at the ticket booth, we have to decide for ourselves what is good and what is evil. Not just passive thought but active thought as well. Sometimes I think that this is the reason that we don’t get answers to prayers because God’s like, “Common, you know this one!”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This scripture makes me wonder if God’s going to hold us accountable for keeping a Journal. I’m not that great at keeping a journal but I think it’s important because it gives us a way to record what we are thankful for and helps us record what means the most to us in our lives.</p>

<p>A great one on missionary work. It makes me think that missionary work is akin to helping people to come home.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a really good one! It brings up a really good example of how we should pray. I know for myself I have a major problem with repeating the same thing over and over again. I think when we let the Holy Ghost guide us in our prayer we do a lot better. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this a great scripture because it shows how the people had such a great experiance their immidiate desire was to share their experiance with others. I think this is a great example of how excited we should be to share the gospel.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This teaches the important lesson that we need to remember that christ always wants us. He never ever is too ashamed of us. He doesn’t only want to have the top 10% be saved he would save everyone if he could, and we all can if we turn and follow him.</p>

<p>I think this is such a beautifull verse! It gives me hope to see Christ tell us that we can be saved. A simple and perhaps obvious truth, but a beautifull one none the less.</p>

<p>This one is a really interesting one because it seems the song ruined it for me for a while because the song doesn’t include any of verses before it. With the verse before it you realize that he’s talking about people who say they follow Christ but don’t live it. Always a good reminder to me to make sure I’m a Mormon in word as well as deed.</p>
