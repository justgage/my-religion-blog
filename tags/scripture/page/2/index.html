<p>I like this scripture because it shows the great integrity of Moroni! He will not, without a doubt deny the Christ so there’s nothing he can do if they put him to that test. So he runs. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This was the introduction to the chapter, but I found it interesting. It makes me think that the Lord, tries to make this very easy for us to figure out, he makes things go well when we are doing the right thing and bad when they are not, or we need to learn somthing, perhaps even see if we can handle a good time). We just have to look for it. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this just shows what a bad leader can influence their followers. It helps me know the need for good leadership. Also I think it’s important to not get into the mentality of, “I was forced!” because despite how much pressure a bad leader can put on us, they can’t technically make us do anything.</p>
<p>How have you been influenced by someone in charge for bad or for good?</p>

<p>I think this is a powerful testimony because it shows hundreds of years before Moroni knew Joseph Smith was going to come. I think often times we take for granted how amazing that is! The Lord really is amazing isn’t he?</p>

<p>I think it’s interesting how here we have they anticipating what the Lord will ask them to do and asking him. I think this shows initiative which I think often times we lack.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is all the more powerful if we think about what just happened. His plea for repentance is too late for his people but it’s not too late for us. What a very powerful testimony!</p>

<p>I think this a great glipse into the character of Mormon. It shows that even as a child he was very obedient and listened to the lord well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Being a prophet isn’t easy! The lord doesn’t only tell you to preach when they will repent but also when they won’t. I had to remember this when I was on my mission (and now) because often times you may think that people are lost causes because they don’t react to feeling the Holy Ghost or they get worse when you want them to get better. We just have to remember that the Lord does everything in his power (short of forcing us) to help us come back. But the reality is, we still have our choice! We can choose to go against God. We are the creators of our own destiny. Don’t dispair when your friends don’t accept the gospel. You gave them a choice and that’s a good thing. </p>

<p>This is quite the interesting look into the law of consecration! It is crazy to think of how easily it solves world hunger and many other ills of life. Naturally it also takes complete selflessness as well. It was interesting once I had a companion who said that missions pretty much where the law of consecration! We got the money we needed and a little more in exchange for the leibor we did! I think this will be amazing when it does happen because it means all good jobs will be adequately paid, especially teachers. </p>
