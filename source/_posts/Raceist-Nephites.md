> 10 And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.
> ~ Helaman 14

I think this is an interesting scripture that shows that perhaps there was even
some racisim between the Nephites and the Lamanites. This never occored to me
before! I know racisim isn't as bad as it was once but that doesn't mean we
don't have to worry about being judgemental.
