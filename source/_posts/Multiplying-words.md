> 24 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not multiply many words, for it was given unto them what they should pray, and they were filled with desire.
> ~ 3 Nephi 19

This is a really good one! It brings up a really good example of how we should pray. I know for myself I have a major problem with repeating the same thing over and over again. I think when we let the Holy Ghost guide us in our prayer we do a lot better.
