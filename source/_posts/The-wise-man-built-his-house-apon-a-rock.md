> 24 Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock—
> 
> 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.
> 
> 26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand—
> 
> 27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.
> ~ 3 Nephi 14

This one is a really interesting one because it seems the song ruined it for me for a while because the song doesn't include any of verses before it. With the verse before it you realize that he's talking about people who say they follow Christ but don't live it. Always a good reminder to me to make sure I'm a Mormon in word as well as deed.
