> 21 And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
> 
> 22 And they understood me not, for they supposed it had been the Gentiles; for they understood not that the Gentiles should be converted through their preaching.
> 
> 23 And they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my voiceâ€”that I should not manifest myself unto them save it were by the Holy Ghost.
> ~ 3 Nephi 15

I think this is interesting. It shows how the savior used parables to only let out that information that those who are dilligent will figure out. The people that he wants to reveal information to. Another reminder to make sure that I look more closely at what he says and what the current prophet says.
