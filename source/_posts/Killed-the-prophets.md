> Ether 9:29 But the people believed not the words of the prophets, but they cast them out; and some of them they cast into pits and left them to perish. And it came to pass that they did all these things according to the commandment of the king, Heth.
 
I think this just shows what a bad leader can influence their followers. It helps me know the need for good leadership. Also I think it's important to not get into the mentality of, "I was forced!" because despite how much pressure a bad leader can put on us, they can't technically make us do anything.
  
How have you been influenced by someone in charge for bad or for good?
