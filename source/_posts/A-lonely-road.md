> 1 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come to battle again until ten years more had passed away. And behold, I had employed my people, the Nephites, in preparing their lands and their arms against the time of battle.

> 2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this peopleâ€”Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build up again my church, and ye shall be spared.

> 3 And I did cry unto this people, but it was in vain; and they did not realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them a chance for repentance. And behold they did harden their hearts against the Lord their God.

Being a prophet isn't easy! The lord doesn't only tell you to preach when they will repent but also when they won't. I had to remember this when I was on my mission (and now) because often times you may think that people are lost causes because they don't react to feeling the Holy Ghost or they get worse when you want them to get better. We just have to remember that the Lord does everything in his power (short of forcing us) to help us come back. But the reality is, we still have our choice! We can choose to go against God. We are the creators of our own destiny. Don't dispair when your friends don't accept the gospel. You gave them a choice and that's a good thing.
