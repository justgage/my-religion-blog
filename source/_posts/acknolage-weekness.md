> "Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercyâ€”yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times."
> ~ Alma 38:14

This reminded me that I need to acknolage my weekness and unworthiness to the Lord constantly. In school I often think of the terms, "I'm smart" and "I'm dumb" but in reality I'm somewhere in the middle and I'm also in desprate need of my father in heaven's help.
