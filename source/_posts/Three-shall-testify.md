> 2 And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may show the plates unto those who shall assist to bring forth this work;
> 
> 3 And unto three shall they be shown by the power of God; wherefore they shall know of a surety that these things are true.
>  
> 4 And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established; and the testimony of three, and this work, in the which shall be shown forth the power of God and also his word, of which the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear recordâ€”and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world at the last day.
> 
> 5 And if it so be that they repent and come unto the Father in the name of Jesus, they shall be received into the kingdom of God.
> ~ Ether 5

I think this is a powerful testimony because it shows hundreds of years before Moroni knew Joseph Smith was going to come. I think often times we take for granted how amazing that is! The Lord really is amazing isn't he?
