I've been on this assignment for like 3 days now. Started in probably at least 3 different languages. Spent hours thinking about how to solve it without brute forcing it too bad. I think it really hit me today that one of my major weaknesses as a programmer is my perfectionism gets in the way and then things that should of taken me a few hours end up taking me a few days. Which is pretty much what literally happened the last few days. Hopefully they will appreciate my solution. It's really not all that impressive sadly because I spent forever trying to find out a way to make it faster and all "functional"
