Lately I've been getting very behind in my studies. It's hard to say where all the time in the day goes. But I do know that I 'futt'. Meaning that I fiddle and waste time just looking at a blog post out (blank) and play a game for `factorial(timeIMentToSpend)`. How do I solve this? I feel I need to give myself more pourpose, I need to realize what I do now _will_ effect my grade latter. Not to mention _how much I learn_. I think I really need to become passionate about doing what I do. Really become a computer science.
