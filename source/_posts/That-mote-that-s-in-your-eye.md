> 1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.
> 
> 2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
> 
> 3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
> 
> 4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye—and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
> 
> 5 Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
> ~ 3 Nephi 14

One that we all need to hear. It reminds me of a TED talk where she said, Realizing your wrong may feel awful but _being_ wrong feels like being __right__. We notice the faults all to easily when they are before us. Somtimes we are our worst critic.
