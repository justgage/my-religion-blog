I think we've all heard how, "Wickedness never was happiness" yet I think this really solidified it in my mind. It is just simply _impossible_ to be happy and to be wicked. It's the great lie that Satan has been eternially trying to sell.  Why? Most likely because it's the only way that what he does is legitimate at all. He has to lie to himself to live with himself each day. Every evil person does.

So will you live the path of denial, or self deceit? Or are you going to truly be happy? It's your choice!
