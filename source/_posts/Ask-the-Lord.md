> 38...Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is choice above all the earth? And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our inheritance.
> ~ Ether 1

I think it's interesting how here we have they anticipating what the Lord will ask them to do and asking him. I think this shows initiative which I think often times we lack.
