> ...Behold, you marvel why these things should be known so long beforehand. Behold, I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as a soul will be at the time of his coming?
> 
> 18 Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be made known unto this people as well as unto their children?
> 
> 19 Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel to declare these glad tidings unto us as unto our children, or as after the time of his coming?

I really like this scripture because it focuses on how God cares very deeply for his children. He carefully plans ways that we can return to him.
