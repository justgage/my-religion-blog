> 3 And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift.
> ~ 4 Nephi 1

This is quite the interesting look into the law of consecration! It is crazy to think of how easily it solves world hunger and many other ills of life. Naturally it also takes complete selflessness as well. It was interesting once I had a companion who said that missions pretty much where the law of consecration! We got the money we needed and a little more in exchange for the leibor we did! I think this will be amazing when it does happen because it means all good jobs will be adequately paid, especially teachers.
