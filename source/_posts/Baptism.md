> 1 And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and teachers were baptized; and they were not baptized save they brought forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it.
> 
> 2 Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins.
> 
> 3 And none were received unto baptism save they took upon them the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.
> 
> 4 And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.
> ~ Moroni 6

Here is one of the best descriptions of (some of) the requirements of baptism. I think these are very important to remember because they apply not just to _getting_ baptised but also to keeping the benefits of _being_ baptised. None of them are easy to do! Having a broken heart and a contrite spirit all the time is constantly combated by the parts of our hearts that are prideful and contrite is defined as:

> Broken down with grief and penitence; deeply sorrowful for sin because it is displeasing to God; humbly and thoroughly penitent.
> ~ 1913 Webster

Maybe your better than me but I know I don't always my sins as horrible _before_ I do them. Many times is far after I say, "Yeah probably shouldn't have done that" after the fact.

How does seeing these facts effect the way you think about your baptism?
