I find this interesting. I don"t suspect that any of us are engaged in secret combinations of this degree, but I think we do have to watch how much we get into "fitting in". We often times want to be "stylish" or "cool" and perhaps do things we shouldn't, or if nothing else we assosiate ourselves with things we shouldn't.
