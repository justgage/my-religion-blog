> 43 And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy;
>
> 44 But behold I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you;
> ~ 3 Nephi 12

I've thought a lot about this one lately. I think it's all too easy to say, oh I'll love my enimies and not really understand what that all entails. Often times I think we decive ourselves  and think, "I don't really have any enemies. I don't think we can be more wrong. There's a lot of people we don't like and often times we don't even really realize it. They can be co-workers, people we go to school with or even our Family. It's all to easy to love our friends. But to pray for someone while they are in the act of trying to hurt you? Now that is a whole different level of difficulty. We're not going to be perfect at it. I know I'm not, but I think it's a very important rule to live by.
