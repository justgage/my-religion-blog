> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words he said unto them again, after he had expounded all the scriptures unto them which they had received, he said unto them: Behold, other scriptures I would that ye should write, that ye have not.
> 3 Nephi 13:6 

This scripture makes me wonder if God's going to hold us accountable for keeping a Journal. I'm not that great at keeping a journal but I think it's important because it gives us a way to record what we are thankful for and helps us record what means the most to us in our lives.
