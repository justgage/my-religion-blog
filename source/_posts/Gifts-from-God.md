It's almost Christmas and we all want presents right? Well ti seems that God is the most liberal giver of all! He really will give us what we want, _if_ it's good for us and _if_ we show we really desire it. The scripture above talks about spiritual gifts in particular but I think that his offer really is open to just about everything in our life.
