> 6 Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them,

> 7 O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea, even they are
> less than the dust of the earth.

> 8 For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the

> ~ Helaman 12

This one is always a good reminder. The natural man is always going to be this way and it's up to us to fight our nature and become children of God.
