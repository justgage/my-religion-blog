> 10 O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them insomuch that they have become extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth.

> 11 Now, O Lord, because of this their humility wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed.
> ~ Helaman 11

I think this is such a perfect example of repentance. It shows that the people humbled themselves and they cast out all evil till they had no more, they had burried up all that had been there. They had truly forsaken it. I think this is a very important thing to remember when we repent, to do it as fully as they did.
