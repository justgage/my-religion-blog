> 1 And it came to pass that he commanded the multitude that they should cease to pray, and also his disciples. And he commanded them that they should not cease to pray in their hearts.
> ~ 3 Nephi 20

This is a simple one, but a good one. It reminds me to pray in my heart and keep God in my thoughts daily as I work my way through dificult times.
