I think what struck me about this scripture was that the Lord told us that __we__ discern between good and evil. Meaning we can't expect God to say, "That's a bad movie" every time we are at the ticket booth, we have to decide for ourselves what is good and what is evil. Not just passive thought but active thought as well. Sometimes I think that this is the reason that we don't get answers to prayers because God's like, "Common, you know this one!".
