I think it's so cool that the Lamanites after converting seem to be even more on fire then the Nephites. I think this is generelly true when it comes to converts in the church. They do a lot more missionary work. However I think it should be the other way arround. People who have grew up in the church should be continually growing more and more spiritual and we should be doing missinary work more than anyone else.
