> 4 And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil. Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame--mortality raised to immortality, corruption to incorruption--raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other--
> 
> 5 The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.
> 
> 6 And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.
> ~ Alma 41

What a powerful verse! It really speaks to me that we are as happy as we decide to be! Which is an empowering (and perhaps frustrating if we're not happy) thing to know.  While sometimes we may feel like it's hard to know if we are good, if we're going to make it, I do find this verse quite enlightening. It seems to reaffirm my suspicions that sin often times has a lot more to do with our _intentions_ then it has to do with our actual actions. But then again our intentions heavily influence our actions so we can't suppose that we are good on the inside and be doing horrible things on the outside. It just doesn't work that way.
