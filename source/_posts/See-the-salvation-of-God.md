> 18 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing, for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion.
> 
> 19 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.
> 
> 20 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of God.
> ~ 3 Nephi 16

I think this is such a beautifull verse! It gives me hope to see Christ tell us that we can be saved. A simple and perhaps obvious truth, but a beautifull one none the less.
