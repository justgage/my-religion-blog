> 6 But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains,saying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil;and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.
> ~ Helaman 16

This scripture shows a pattern that I've started to notice while reading the book of mormon. Evil people always seems to accuse good people of being evil! Even christ himself was often accused of such! My theory is that it's really the only way that evil people can live with themselves. They have to convince themselves that they are good.
