I think this is a thing that we all need to remember, Satan is often the source of bad ideas and bad thoughts. I'm inclined to belive that not every thought in our head is our own (A little bit of a scary thought)! So when you get angry, say to yourself, "That's what Satan wants me to do. And I'm not going to do it!"
