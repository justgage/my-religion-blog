I really can't not write about this one. It's just so true. In this world where we want our [pizza at the push of a button](http://welcome.pushforpizza.com/) we often time say, "Just give me the answer". When often times our ability to reason an choose, to learn endlessly is one of our most prized possessions! I try to always keep this in mind when I end up teaching somone somthing. If they can't do it themselves, they haven't really learned it.
