> 34 And it came to pass that the people did follow the course of the beasts, and did devour the carcasses of them which fell by the way, until they had devoured them all. Now when the people saw that they must perish they began to repent of their iniquities and cry unto the Lord.
> 
> 35 And it came to pass that when they had humbled themselves sufficiently before the Lord he did send rain upon the face of the earth; and the people began to revive again, and there began to be fruit in the north countries, and in all the countries round about. And the Lord did show forth his power unto them in preserving them from famine.
> ~Ether 9

I think what's interesting about this scripture is that they had to be pushed until there was no other way before they finally realized that they had to humble themselves. I find this is (sadly) often how I am as well. Even just today I feel like I had to get that way, where I wouldn't understand anything about my homework and I knew that I didn't have enough time before I started to pray. After that everything worked out, and I need to remember that sooner because I know God appreciates that.
