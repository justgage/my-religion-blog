I chose prayer because I've been doing very badly with doing personal prayers in the moring _and_ I feel like my prayers could be made much more meaningful. I really want to have a more meaningful relationship with God.


Below are a list of reasons for prayer or doctorine about it in general.

> "The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that we must ask for in order to obtain."

> "12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
> 
> 13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart."
> ~ Jerimiah 29:12-13

I really like this verse because it helps me to understand _why_ we pray.


> "44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;"
> ~ Matthew 5

We should even pray for those that hate us! Or abuse us! It must be imperitive.

>  10 Remember that without faith you can do nothing; therefore ask in faith. Trifle not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not.
> ~ D&C 8

This tells me that we really need to be careful what we pray for. If we end up praying for things that are wrong, that could be really bad.

> 37 Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.
> ~ Alma 37

One of the reasons we pray is because we need God's daily direction, not just bailing us out when we're in a jam.  If we do this we shall be lifted up at the last day.

> One of the most meaningful things we can do as parents is teach our children the power of prayer, not just the routine of prayer. 
> PARENTS: THE PRIME GOSPEL TEACHERS OF THEIR CHILDREN by TAD R. CALLISTER

I loved this talk from the last generel confrence and I found this phrase particularly pertinent. IT helpedme to realize that it wasn't enough to just say your dialy prayers but you needed to make sure that you where actually comunicating with God verses just talking at him.
