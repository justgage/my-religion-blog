> _One king succeeds another—Some of the kings are righteous; others are wicked—When righteousness prevails, the people are blessed and prospered by the Lord._ 
> ~ Ether 10

This was the introduction to the chapter, but I found it interesting. It makes me think that the Lord, tries to make this very easy for us to figure out, he makes things go well when we are doing the right thing and bad when they are not, or we need to learn somthing, perhaps even see if we can handle a good time). We just have to look for it.
