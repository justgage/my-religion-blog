> 25 Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming of Christ.
> ~ Moroni 7

This is a scripture I think we need more thean ever in this world. Why? Because today in our society where we have so much that we can fill our time with God commands, "lay hold upon ever good thing" which I belive requires us to let a lot of _ok_ things go in order to make that happen. Things like movies, video games, surfing the itnernet, and TV are prime examples although there's a thosand other ones.
