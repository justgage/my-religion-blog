> 39 And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious a workmanship. And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.
>
> 41 Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means it did show unto them marvelous works. They were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey;
>
> 42 Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions.
> ~ Alma 37

I think it's interesting how they where given such a great gift, of somthing so magical to their time, yet all too soon it became commonplace and they forgot to call apon it. It's also intresting to think of it in contrast with the gift of the Holy Ghost because do we somtimes forget we have it? Do we forget to listen to the spirit and not simply our logic and emotions? I know I do.
