> 25 And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.
> ~ 3 Nephi 18

This teaches the important lesson that we need to remember that christ always wants us. He never ever is too ashamed of us. He doesn't only want to have the top 10% be saved he would save everyone if he could, and we all can if we turn and follow him.
