> 40 And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?
> 
> 41 And Aminadab said unto them: You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.
> ~ Helaman 5

I think these verses are really applicable to us in our lives. Whenever we find ourselves in spiritual darkness we need to ask God sincerely, "What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?" and then do exactly what he asks us to do, which will invariably be some sort of form of repentance.
