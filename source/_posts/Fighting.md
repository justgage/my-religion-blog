I think this is intersting how strong the wording is concerning the disputations that he talks about. The word __grieveth__ seems so strong it makes me think that contentions are very bad in the Lords sight. Yet there is so much fighting in this world! So many arguments. Makes me think I need to work harder to rid myself of them.
