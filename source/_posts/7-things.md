Scripture Activity 1: Moroni 1-7. "I Write a Few More Things"

Moroni stated that he was writing "a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren" (Moroni 1:4). Read through the chapter headings for Moroni 1-7. As you do so, make a list of at least seven truths or teachings that you feel are "of worth" unto the world.

Some doctorine that I think is important:

1. God is real
2. God is our literal father
3. Christ's atonement can heal us if we follow the commandments
4. The Book of Mormon is another testiment of Christ and is true.

5. The Preisthood power is required to preform saving ordinaces (to reach exaltation).
6. Christ's church has been brought back!
7. Families can be together forever!


I think this is a vere that also goes along very well with this topic:

Moroni 7:25 
> Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming of Christ.

because it tells us to lay hold upon the good things which I belive are in part the 7 items above.

Point number 4 can be illistarted perfectly with Moroni chapter 10:

> 3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.
>
> 4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
>
> 5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.
>
> 6 And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is.
>
> 7 And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.
