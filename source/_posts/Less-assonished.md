> And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seenâ€”
> ~ 3 Nephi 1:1

I think this is a really interesting scripture because it shows how quickly we forget. It really reaffirms the fact for me that we can't be _convinced_ the gospel is true, we have to let it into our hearts and gain a testimony willingly and sinserely. Signs just don't work because it really just comes down to, am I willing to be _convinced_, do I __want__ to know the truth?

Another good point from this passage is that we need to be constantly converting ourselves. If we wait too long eventually we will become, "less astonished."
