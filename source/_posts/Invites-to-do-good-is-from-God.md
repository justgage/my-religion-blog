I really like this scripture because it shows us in the simplest way how we can determine what is from him and what isn't. Satan man mix things that are good into what he says but he will never ultimately invite you to love God and serve him (that is the true God). It would go entirely against his pourposes, and therefore he will always have a very nicely sounding idea that ultimately leads to anything but a good destination. 

What are ways you spot Satan or spot God in things?
